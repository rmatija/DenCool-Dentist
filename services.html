									General Dentistry dentists typically do not focus on any particular specialty, instead opting to provide generalized dental care to patients. In some cases, General Dentistry dentists may refer a patient to a specialty provider for care or treatment that is beyond the scope of general dentistry. However, most General Dentistry dentists are capable of providing complete examinations, cleanings, root canals, restorations, extractions and tooth prosthetics. General Dentistry is best when patients use it for preventive care, rather than for corrective treatment. By visiting your Downey Dentist, Dr. Mehregan and his team of hygienists and dental technicians twice annually for cleaning and examination, you can avoid decay and identify potential oral health conditions, such as periodontal disease, in their earliest stages.

									In our experienced hands patients can have beautiful, newly aligned, straight teeth in as few as two visits with porcelain veneers. These thin, natural-looking porcelain shells cover existing teeth to close gaps, whiten, lengthen and properly align teeth. It can be almost like instant orthodontics since porcelain veneers can make a dream smile come to life for an amazing smile makeover. Porcelain veneers is one of the most frequently requested treatments. No single dental treatment has revolutionized cosmetic dentistry more dramatically than the porcelain veneer with its transformative results. With the confidence, health and beauty that veneers infuse into a new smile, patients achieve a life-altering change. What a welcome relief, after years of self-conscious discomfort.

									If a patient has been putting off dental work due to fear, oral sedation dentistry can change all of that. A patient no longer has to be afraid to visit the dentist with the use of a variety of oral medications. On the day of the appointment, the patient will arrive about one hour early for one of our experienced dentists to administer the sedation medication. The pleasant-tasting medication is given by mouth to relax and allow the patient to be comfortable. He or she will be able to enjoy the peace of mind of knowing that all dental needs can easily be taken care of without discomfort. The patient will need a friend or relative to accompany him or her home after treatment.
